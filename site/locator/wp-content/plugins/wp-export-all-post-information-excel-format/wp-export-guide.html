<div><strong>What the WP Export plugin is?<br />
</strong></div>
<p>WP Export is a plugin to get all&nbsp; your blog's <em>published and draft</em> post data in Excel format as output. The post data means, <em>post Title, Description, Excerpt, Categories, Tags and all other custom fields</em> which you have used for your blog post. You can also makes changes in it and and save   as CSV (Comma Delimited) format. Now you can use this CSV file to   import this data wherever you want. What ever data you have inserted in   you CSV file will be inserted to your blog with necessary category and   tags. In case if any category is not already created in the blog, the   plugin will add new category and post will be automatically assigned to it. So   you don't worry about creating category and all. Even via CSV you can   insert all basic post information with post custom fields and images.   You need to insert image name only.&nbsp; Image will be assigned to related folder   in wp-content/uploads folder as per wordpress upload format. You can   see the post images while editing the inserted post, from post media   section above editor. You can see the image data and URL also. Now you   need to upload the images to that folder what you have seen with image   URL. Other way is while you have inserted the post data via <strong>WP Upload/Mass Upload</strong>,   you will given the message for images, how to and where to upload or   transfer the images. Simply follow those instructions and its done.</p>
<p style="color: #e13a27;"><span><u><strong style="color:#FF0000">Note</strong></u>:-   Please make sure &quot;post_title&quot; column should included in  the CSV file   otherwise system will never accept the data. New data will  insert every   time as per the file you are uploading. <u>Backup the database before doing any process</u>. Backup will helpful in the case of any mistake or accident.</span></p>
<p>I   hope this plugin will be helpful to you. Thanks for using it. You can   contact wpwebs team for more information or any update or upgrade of the plugin.</p>
